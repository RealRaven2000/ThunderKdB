As I stated in my post, the reports are still a work in progress.  As 
Graeme rightly pointed out, the inclusion of a "secret decoder ring" would have been
helpful.  I will have a legend/help page shortly.  In the meantime I have included
the cheat sheet.  Note, I reserve the right to modify these either as I see fit
or by anyone's good suggestions.  Seriously, I do plan to make some tweaks.

Rationale/comments:
- green  ===  good, light green === very good (tb68, always first flag to see easily)
- cV , pV : current, previous version (some people ping-pong to officially support both 60/68)
- 61+ : author has worked past 60, good indication they will hit 68
- 69+ : author has worked past 68, good indication they will continue towards 76
- MailExtension flag is kind of ambiguous.  Currently it just means a manifest file is included.
  It says nothing beyond that.  I am thinking of modifying or combining with the legacy flags
- No maximum version just strives to flag that you cannot count on specific compatibility beyond 
  any other representation.
- Legacy flags currently only get read from the manifest file.  For "non- mailextensions"
  I will be adding an RDF parser so I can look at it install.rdf

I will also be adding some more status information such as :
oWIP  ===  original author, work in progress (feel-good flag)
rWIP === new author for replacement extension, work in progress
AdoptMe === extension looking for a new home

As I progress there may be other things.  Again, suggestions welcome.  Note!  If possible
please make an enhancement issue in the repository so we can track.
