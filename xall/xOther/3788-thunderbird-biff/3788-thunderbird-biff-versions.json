In response to a suggestion made in a user review by \"russff\", added the capability to select those email accounts to be monitored by this addon. By default, all email accounts are monitored. But users may employ the multiple-select list box in the addon's options panel to select a subset in which they are interested.\n3. Updated the addon's Options Panel which was very much in need of some attention. Now it better supports users who are not on the Windows platform. Now all platforms will behave almost identically with changes to settings being saved as soon as they are made. There is no longer a need for Windows users to dismiss the dialog in order for changes be saved. This also results in validation checks being run on non-Windows platforms that have been ignored until now."

So with this release, a new option has been added which permits the user to specify the fully qualified path to their Thunderbird executable. With this option correctly set, this addon will be able to launch Thunderbird properly on all clients and OS's. Sorry for the inconvenience.

            "en-US": "New in version 2.1 of ThunderbirdBiff\n\n(a) Refinements in server-side processing of multiple BiffState folder events occurring within a very short time. This generally happens only at Thunderbird startup. This should offer little visible change to the end user.\n\n(b) Added a reminder to install in both clients and Thunderbird on the add-on's Options dialog.\n\n(c) Now \"supports\" Thunderbird 2 beta versions. I put \"supports\" in quotes because I have not personally tested this and all I did was change the MaxVersion attribute in the install.rdf file. But the result has been tested by and approved by an actual user of Thunderbird 2 (on Windows XP) - thanks Don!\n\n(d) Encouraged and helped enthusiastically by Andy McDonald (author of the FoxClocks add-on) who provided a set of essential \"boiler plate\" code for doing this, I have recast much of this add-on's code in the form of Javascript XPCOM components. This permits me to remove the last of the \"ugly hacks\" I employed in previous versions of this add-on (at least of which I am aware). Again, there is no visible change to the user from this effort. Thanks once\nagain Andy! Could not have done this without you - I would not have even tried.\n\n(e) Added a boolean option (named \"thunderbirdbiff.logToFile\") controlling verbose logging to a file. This option is diabled by default. Changing this option requires a restart to take effect. The add-on's options dialog shows the directory where these files will be stored. Log file names begin with \"thunderbirdbiff\" and are suffixed with the Mozilla application name (firefox, sunbird, thunderbird). A new log file is created each time an application is started and these files can become large. So this option should typically be\nenabled only for debugging purposes. As always, detailed log information is also sent to the console if the application is started with the -console option (and the preference \"browser.dom.window.dump.enabled\" is true). Messages of general importance and errors are, as before, sent to the Javascript Console in Thunderbird and the Error Console in Firefox and Sunbird as well.\n\n(f) I am not sure if this will be required... But due to the changes in (d) above, upgrading users MAY need to remove the files compreg.dat and xpti.dat found in their client and Thunderbird profile directories (by default C:Documents and SettingsApplication DataThunderbirdProfiles and C:Documents and\nSettingsApplication DataMozillaFirefoxProfiles). Then restart all applications. Doing so will force each application to re-register its add-ons. Sorry for this inconvenience should it be required."

            "en-US": "(a) Changed socket handling to reduce overhead. This may occasionally cause an additional polling cycle to be required before a client (Firefox/Sunbird) is\nproperly updated. I see this as an acceptable trade-off versus the allocation and use of a new TCP port with every polling cycle by every client.\n\n(b) Permit the port used for IPC between both sides of the add-on to be configured in case the default of 25501 is in use. This is controlled via the new integer preference \"thunderbirdbiff.port\". If the value given is in the range of \"well-known ports\" (&lt; 1023), the setting is ignored and the default used. This value MUST be identical in both Thunderbird and any/all clients for this add-on to function.\n\n(c) In version 1.02, the new mail icon was changed to employ an animated gif to yield a \"flashing arrow\" effect. It is possible that animated gifs may be\nblocked or otherwise disabled. So the animated gif can now be replaced with a static image, if desired. This is controlled via the new boolean preference\n\"thunderbirdbiff.useAnimation\". By default, animations are enabled and the value of this preference is true. This preference can vary between Thunderbird and clients.\n\n(d) In previous versions, both sides of the add-on engaged in a polling activity based upon the value of the integer preference called \"thunderbirdbiff.intervalSeconds\". With this version, all polling activity has been removed from the Thunderbird side of the add-on. Hence, the\n\"thunderbirdbiff.intervalSeconds\" preference is required only in any/all clients using this add-on. If specified in Thunderbird, it is ignored.\n\n(e) In previous versions, the user was given no control over the location of this add-on's icon in the statusbar. At the suggestion of Andy McDonald, I\nhave offered this capability. Based upon the value of a new string preference called \"thunderbirdbiff.position\", an attempt is made to position this add-on's icon on the far left or far right of the statusbar. Values equal to \"left\" or \"right\" are accepted. The default is \"right\". Unfortunately, different add-ons contend for these highly desired locations and there seems to be no way to warranty that either one will be respected after all add-ons have been loaded. This preference can vary between Thunderbird and clients.\n\n(f) In previous versions, changes made to this add-on's preferences required a restart of the application to take effect. At the suggestion of Andy McDonald, I have added support for the changing of preferences dynamically. A restart of the application is no longer required for the changes to take effect.\n\n(g) This add-on uses TCP/IP sockets for communication between Thunderbird and clients. In previous versions, the add-on REQUIRED that both server and clients be running on the same computer. For those who wish otherwise, this version now permits you to specify the hostname of the computer on which the client side of the add-on will seek the running Thunderbird to which it should connect. This is controlled by the new preference called \"thunderbirdbiff.hostname\". The default value for this preference is \"localhost\" but you can enter the name or IP address of any \"reachable\"\ncomputer (try ping'ing that name first). The \"thunderbirdbiff.hostname\" preference is required only in the client portion of the add-on. If specified\nin Thunderbird, it is ignored.\n\n(h) As a by-product of support for a user-specified hostname (see g above) for this add-on to use in Firefox, the add-on can now support multiple clients polling from different computers. When Thunderbird's new mail state changes, all connected clients receive notification.\n\n(i) Added at least rudimentary support for Sunbird version 0.3 as a client for this add-on. Note: it seems that sometimes you must manipulate the main Sundbird window before this add-on's icon is displayed properly. I am not sure why this is so.\n\n(j) Some bug fixes and extensive renaming and encapsulation of methods to avoid potential (and, in one case apparently, actual) collision with symbols\ndefined by other extensions.\n\n(k) Now includes an add-on Options Panel so that configuration is much easier."
