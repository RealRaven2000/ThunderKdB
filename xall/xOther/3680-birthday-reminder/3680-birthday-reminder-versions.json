Hint: you need to delete existing calendar entries in order to get an effect. \nImprovement: About-dialog now shows current information from www.mybirthdayreminder.org \nBugfix: Reminder eMail now shows date of next birthday, not the date of birth \nBugfix: UTF-8 encoding used for IFrame, using correct functions to get file URL \nKnown issues\nSyncing with Google Calendar results in duplicate entries. This behaviour is a result of the Google Calendar implementation: Google Calendar changes the IDs of the created events. Because of this, BirthdayReminder does not find the previously created event for the birthday and creates a new event. There will be no changes in Birthday Reminder because of this.
