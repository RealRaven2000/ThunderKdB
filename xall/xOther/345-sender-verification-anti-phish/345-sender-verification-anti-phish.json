        "en-US": "This is an extension that reports, when possible, whether the sender shown in the From: header was actually the sender of the email. In fact, forging the From: address is possible! This is intended to be a tool to identify phishing attacks, fraudulent emails asking for your sensitive data, so that you don't fall prey. The extension uses Sender Policy Framework (SPF) (albeit in a nonstandard way) to verify the sending domain and SURBL, Spamhaus, DNSWL, and SenderScoreCertified for reputation information on the domain."

Not all emails can be verified, so don't be surprised if the extension has nothing to report for most of your email.  When you see an email *is* verified, then you can have more, but not complete, confidence in its authenticity.\n\nCritics say the extension uses SPF improperly by comparing the From: address of emails, rather than the return path, against SPF records.  it's really besides the point, so don't worry about that.\n\nMany have suggested checking the Received-SPF and Authentication-Results mail headers.  There's no way to know if these headers have been inserted by your ISP or by the malicious phisher, so the extension simply ignores them."
