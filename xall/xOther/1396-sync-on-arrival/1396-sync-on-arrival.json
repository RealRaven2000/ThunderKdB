Kudos to Ketil Lund who reported this problem and greatly helped me in ironing out the kinks of this new release.\n\n* Added a nifty new \"Report a Bug\" wizard (available from the \"Options\" dialog) to encourage users to write bug reports when something's not working, and to help them doing it in a way that's useful to me."

Normally, Thunderbird won't download message headers (let alone bodies) until the folder they're in is opened.\n\nAs an additional benefit, this keeps Saved Search folders up-to-date in IMAP accounts even if \"search online\" isn't checked.  Very handy if you have a Saved Search configured to show all of your unread email."

It asks a few question and then pre-compiles an email for you which you can review, change (if you want to) and send.  The information it adds automatically is your exact Thunderbird version and the names and versions of the extensions you are using.  Please use it!\n\nBUGS I CANNOT REPRODUCE CANNOT BE FIXED. Sorry. :-/ I simply can't do anything about bugs that I can't trace back to their root cause, so I need your information to make my system behave more like yours (including the buggy behavior).\n\nSource code:\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/fe31c4a8fb3ffbf8d5b7ba0b5628242b179ad80226f0d7c331a11fe9ee95b584/http%3A//home.buschbeck.net/viewcvs/Thunderbird-SyncOnArrival/\">http://home.buschbeck.net/viewcvs/Thunderbird-SyncOnArrival/</a>"
