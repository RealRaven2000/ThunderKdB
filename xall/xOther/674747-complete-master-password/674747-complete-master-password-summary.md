# ![Extension icon](https://addons.thunderbird.net/static/img/addon-icons/default-64.png) Complete master password : Extension Summary

Name: Complete master password  
Id: 674747  
Slug: complete-master-password  
Description: The goal is to avoid to have to enter the master password on application startUp.
The extension is not self-sufficient, a script has to extract the master for a secure storage like gnome-keyring, then to transfer it through an environment variable.
