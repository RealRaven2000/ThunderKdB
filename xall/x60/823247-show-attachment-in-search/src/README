Add 'attachment column' to search results
=========================

Unlike other message lists, the search result window does not allow to show the attachment column.

The addon adds this column to the window.

It helps in a typical scenario like this: Some time in September, AAA send the contract as attachment to an email. 
I don't remember the date, the exact subject or other email criteria. How to find it?

With the addon: use search criteria as necessary. See the full flow of messages, select the one with attachment which you search for.
