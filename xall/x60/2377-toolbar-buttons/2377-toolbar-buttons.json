Instead I will be splitting it into smaller extensions which I will upload.  I am keeping a list of which ones are <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/f39aded63d386605b73ac52a7e6bed5b55744eb9a7d8f9e515772b2c9735637b/https%3A//codefisher.org/toolbar_button/webextensions/\">WebExtension enabled here</a>.  \nFor those buttons that opened different pages, you can get them from my <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/e43d5d4fff4521210cd21839a0510d87d5a0f7422f2e26ef2af4dde1193d6cd3/https%3A//codefisher.org/toolbar_button/link-button/\">Link Buttons page</a> or make your own with my <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/ba0dae7fdc91656d15bf2bf3226487d399920ff1290381282ae439d361c933eb/https%3A//codefisher.org/toolbar_button/link-button-maker/\">Link Button Maker</a>.\n\nAny future releases of Toolbar Buttons itself would only support Thunderbird, Palemoon or SeaMonkey.  \n\nToolbar Buttons is the single biggest button pack for Firefox or Thunderbird there is.  There are now over 100 Firefox, 50 for Thunderbird. You will find buttons that enable hidden functionality or is too many clicks away, but some of the best buttons are those unique to the extension.  For example from some of out most popular buttons, there are menu items for, Options,  Bookmark Manager, Bookmark Page, and Add-ons, but for Snap Back, Restart and about:config there is no existing user interface.\n\n    To find out more information about each of the buttons, please see our <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/d1413d058b53eeddb023d49b0ad6701438c0a7017d8915a8fd135e22315d964a/https%3A//codefisher.org/toolbar_button/button_list/\"><strong>Button List</strong></a> which has descriptions of all the buttons.\n\nOnce installed to get started using the buttons open the Customize Coolbar window by either right clicking on the toolbar and selecting <strong>Customize</strong> from the pop up menu or going <strong>View</strong> then <strong>Toolbars</strong> then <strong>Customize</strong> and from the window that opens up you can drag the buttons to your toolbar. \n\nIf you don't want so many buttons in one extension you can choose individually using the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/03eb997bed0703d3eaa8b198763f97104f98b0240f696b2d8a25391c74a7d462/https%3A//codefisher.org/toolbar_button/toolbar_button_maker/\">Toolbar Button maker</a>.  This tool also had extra features such as being able to create toolbar.
