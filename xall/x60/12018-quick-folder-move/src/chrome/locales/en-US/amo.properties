Quick Folder Move

[shortdesc]
When filing messages, you can use the keyboard shortcuts to quickly search for the folder to move the message to. The long description has info on how to use the extension. If no search term is entered, a list of recent folders will show up instead.

[longdesc]
Use the keyboard to quickly move messages and navigate folders. First of all, use one of the following keyboard shortcuts:
<ul>
  <li><b>Shift+M</b> opens a context menu that allows you to move the currently selected messages</li>
  <li><b>Shift+G</b> opens a context menu that allows you to navigate to the folder you've entered</li>
</ul>
Then enter parts of the folder you want to move the message to. Pressing Enter will move the message to the first entry in the search results. If you'd rather use the context menus, the Move To/Copy To context menus have also been modified to use the quick folder move menu.

<b>KNOWN ISSUES</b>
Using Shift+G to open a folder not shown in the view uses a Thunderbird native function to select the folder. This function changes to the default view (all folders) if the folder is not visible (i.e contains no unread messages).
