This extension for Thunderbird 60+ adds a "Manually sort folders" entry into
the Tools menu. Use it to, hum, manually sort your accounts and folders (that was obvious,
wasn't it?).

I sometimes put a development version
[online](https://jonathan.protzenko.fr/manually-sort-folders/), but over the
past eight years, I've only updated this addon twice, as it is very stable; so your
best bet is to just stick with the publicly available version on AMO.
