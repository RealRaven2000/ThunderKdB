<h1>BACKING UP DATA</h1>

<p>If you need to backup your data or move it from one machine to another
you need to take a copy of the profile folder. This is located in:</p>

<pre><code>%APPDATA%\Thunderbird (Windows)
~/.thunderbird (Linux)
~/Library/Application Support/Thunderbird (Mac OS X)
</code></pre>

<p>It is highly recommended that you back up your profile folder and store it in a safe location whenever you create a new notebook unless you setup your own location of the new notebook. Without a backup, there is no way to recover your data if they are lost!</p>
