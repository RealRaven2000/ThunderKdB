The icons in this folder (justduet.tumblr) are distributed under fair use and are based on the great artwork from justduet.tumblr. I only resized and cropped them to fit into a 32px2 avatar icon.

She has all rights to the original full-sized artwork. I only made these to test and for personal use, please visit JustDuet's tumblr or deviantart page to show your appreciation:

Can I use your art on my site/stream/etc?

You can use any of my fan art pieces as long as you credit me (pref with a link back to my tumblr). If you have a high traffic site I would appreciate it a lot if you could put in some good words about me to your visitors ;D~ If you want to work together/be partners and get free art done for you in exchange for advertising, please contact me privately. :)
