The icons in this folder (skence.deviantart) are distributed under fair use and are based on the great artwork from skence.deviantart. I only resized and cropped them to fit into a 32px2 avatar icon.

He has all rights to the original full-sized artwork. I only made these to test and for personal use, please visit Skence's Deviantart page to show your appreciation:
