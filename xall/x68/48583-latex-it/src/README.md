Latex It!
=========

Description
-----------

This extension allows you to run LaTeX on your computer to automatically
generate images for all expression $expr$ found while composing your email. You
can also render possibly more complex sets of LaTeX, and have them inserted as
images. You can undo the LaTeX run if the formulae you inserted were wrongly
typeset, and you can customize the appearance of your formulae.

Since everything is run on your own computer, you're in control!

Usage
-----

This extension is provided as a set of files. Please run make to build a working
xpi. Alternatively, you can create a file named "tblatex@xulforum.org" in your
extensions/ directory with a single line containing the path to this folder.
