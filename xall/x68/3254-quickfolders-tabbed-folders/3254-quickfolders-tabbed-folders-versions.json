Registration keys can be obtained via various licensing links from within the software (Options/QuickFolders Pro tab, QuickFolders context menu, premium notification messages). The profits from Registration are used to develop and distribute the program further and to feed the author, as he would like to spend more time developing open source software. Some Premium features may be available in the free software, but they may be restricted (e.g. through a notification to the registration). Premium features are not essential to the core functionality of the Program, but are there to provide an incentive for financially supporting the enhancement and support of the Software. \n\nRegistration Scheme\nRegistration is carried out via our web shop (FastSpring) which sells registration keys. Registration keys are personal, non-transferrable and usually restricted to a time period (typically one year). To protect their personal nature they are tied to the user's Email address.\n\nMotivation \nAs regards licensing, we want to avoid a situation where the project is reused in order to avoid our monetisation by giving this away for free or cheaper than us thus disincentivising the current developers from putting a lot of time into development and support.\n\nIf plan to you use large portions of the code please contact the author (Axel Grude)\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
