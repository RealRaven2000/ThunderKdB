# NOMPSORT MX/No Message Pane Sort for Mozilla Thunderbird

A mailextension for Thunderbird that prevents accidental message sorting.

Do you accidentally resort your messages because your mouse click hits
the message pane header instead of the top most message?

Then NOMPSORT MX is the addon you've been looking for. It disables
mouse buttons clicks on the message pane headers and your message list
stays sorted all the time. But just in case you do need to resort your
messages: You can still do it by ctrl-clicking or command-clicking on
the header.
