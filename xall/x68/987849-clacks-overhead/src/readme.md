## Message Display

In tribute to the late Sir Terry Pratchett many users are adding the message "GNU Terry Pratchett" into the email header "X-Clacks-Overhead". This plugin allows you to see when an email is using the header and read the message included. The message is also displayed visually in the semaphore style from the board game "Clacks" by Backspindle Games.
