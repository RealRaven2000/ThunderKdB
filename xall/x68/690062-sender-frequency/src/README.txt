Sender Frequency
================

This is a "no frills" add-on. No configuration, only one option.
In the configuration editor you can edit: extensions.Sfreq.compareEmailOnly
true (default): Comparison by e-mail only:
Donald Duck <donald@duck.com> and Don Duck <donald@duck.com> count as the same address.
false: Comparison by full sender address:
Donald Duck <donald@duck.com> and Don Duck <donald@duck.com> count as two different addresses.
This is useful for mailing lists where all messages come from the same address.
A restart is required for changes to the option to take effect.

The add-on adds a custom column "SFreq" for the Sender Frequency to the thread pane.
In Sent folders a "RFreq" column is added for the Recipient Frequency.

This add-on requires Thunderbird 68 or higher.
