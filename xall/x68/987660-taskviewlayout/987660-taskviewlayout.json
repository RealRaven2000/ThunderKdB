It is more stable in 72.0b1 than 71.0b.\nSo, I use Thunderbird 72.0b1 now.\nThanks Mozilla Calendar Project team! \\o/\n\nVersion 57.0 (upcoming)\nHorizontal/vertical task views were resizable.\nHorizontal/vertical task views are not changing when clicking other tabs.\nFunctionality of TaskviewLayout has been completed.\nFlex refresh button was added to edit item description.\n\nVersion 57.1 (upcoming)\nJsonToDOM scripts were used to port messenger.xhtml over TB73.\n\npraise Cardinal Soo-Hwan, Kim.",
