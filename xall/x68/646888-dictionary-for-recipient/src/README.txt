Dictionary for recipient
========================

Sets the spell check dictionary based on the first recipient ("To" field).

The dictionary needs to be defined in the "Custom 4" field of the contact in the address book.
"Custom 4" can be found in the "Other" tab of the contact.
You need to set the language code as used by the dictionary.
Examples: en-US, en-AU, en-GB, de-DE, es-ES, it-IT, fr-modern.
Please ensure that you get the language code correct, otherwise it will not work
(and there won't be an error message).

The add-on notifies in the status area of the message compose window when it sets the dictionary.

This is a "no frills" add-on. No configuration, no options.

This add-on requires Thunderbird 68 or higher.
